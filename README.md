# Fire-System
This project is a fire detection and response system built around the ATmega32 microcontroller. It monitors temperature, pressure, and smoke levels to detect fire hazards and trigger appropriate safety mechanisms. The system operates in three states with responsive control over actuators like a buzzer, pump, air conditioner (fan), and LEDs.
